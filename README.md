graph = platform.knowledge_graph.get_graph()

# Analyze research connections
print(f"Total research nodes: {len(graph.nodes())}")
print(f"Total connections: {len(graph.edges())}")

# View node types
for node, data in graph.nodes(data=True):
    print(f"{node}: {data['type']}")
```

## Architecture
### Pipeline Flow
1. **Hypothesis Generation**: Based on literature review and domain knowledge
2. **Experiment Design**: Creates protocols with variables and methodology
3. **Data Acquisition**: Simulates experimental data collection

### Data Models

#### Hypothesis
```python
class Hypothesis(BaseModel):
    text: str        # The research hypothesis
    domain: str      # Research domain
```

#### ExperimentProtocol
```python
class ExperimentProtocol(BaseModel):
    hypothesis: str  # Original hypothesis
    steps: list      # Experimental steps
    variables: dict  # Independent, dependent, control variables
```

#### Findings

class Findings(BaseModel):
    results: dict    # Statistical results
    conclusion: str  # Research conclusion
```

## Mock LLM System
The platform includes a sophisticated mock LLM that provides:
- **Domain-specific hypotheses**: Tailored to research areas
- **Experiment protocols**: Structured methodologies
- **Peer review comments**: Academic feedback
- **Publication formatting**: Academic paper structure

### Sample Hypotheses by Domain

**Machine Learning**:
- "Does transfer learning improve model performance on small datasets?"
- "Can attention mechanisms enhance time series prediction accuracy?"

**Artificial Intelligence**:
- "Does multi-modal learning improve reasoning capabilities?"
- "Can reinforcement learning solve complex planning problems?"

**Data Science**:
- "Does feature engineering improve predictive model accuracy?"
- "Can dimensionality reduction preserve information quality?"

## Output Structure

The platform returns comprehensive results including:

```json
{
  "hypothesis": {
    "text": "Research hypothesis",
    "domain": "Research domain"
  },
  "protocol": {
    "hypothesis": "Original hypothesis",
    "steps": ["Experimental steps"],
    "variables": {"variable types"}
  },
  "findings": {
    "results": {"Statistical analysis"},
    "conclusion": "Research conclusion"
  },
  "review": {
    "valid": true,
    "comments": "Peer review feedback"
  },
  "publication": {
    "paper_id": "Unique identifier",
    "content": "Formatted publication"
  },
  "graph_nodes": ["Knowledge graph nodes"],
  "graph_edges": ["Knowledge graph connections"]
}
```

## Error Handling
The platform includes robust error handling for:
- **Ethical violations**: Detects and prevents unethical research
- **Invalid protocols**: Fallback mechanisms for experiment design
- **Failed peer review**: Quality control measures
- **Pipeline failures**: Comprehensive error reporting

## Example Research Scenarios
### Transfer Learning Study
```python
# The platform might generate:
# Hypothesis: "Does transfer learning improve model performance on small datasets?"
# Protocol: Source dataset preparation â†’ Pre-training â†’ Target adaptation
# Analysis: Performance comparison across dataset sizes
```

### Ensemble Methods Research
```python
# The platform might generate:
# Hypothesis: "Can ensemble methods improve robustness in noisy environments?"
# Protocol: Model ensemble creation â†’ Noise injection â†’ Robustness testing
# Analysis: Robustness scores across noise levels
```

## Extensibility

### Adding New Domains
Extend the `hypothesis_templates` in MockLLM:
```python
self.hypothesis_templates["new_domain"] = [
    "Domain-specific hypothesis 1",
    "Domain-specific hypothesis 2"
]
```

### Custom Agents
Create new agents by inheriting from base patterns:
```python
class CustomAnalysisAgent:
    def __init__(self, llm):
        self.llm = llm
    
    def custom_analysis(self, data):
        # Implementation
        pass
```

## Limitations
- **Mock Data**: Uses simulated datasets for demonstration
- **Offline Operation**: No external API calls or real literature access
- **Simplified Statistics**: Basic statistical analysis implementation
- **Limited Domains**: Focused on AI/ML research areas

## Future Enhancements
